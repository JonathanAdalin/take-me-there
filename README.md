## Voice recognition to travel the world in Google Street View in Virtual Reality

Have you ever wanted to travel far and wide, but for different reasons were not able to? 

Our application allows users to be transported to a desired location with just their voice. They are immersed using VR technology using their handheld device, and their commands are interpreted by state-of-the-art voice recognition by Nuance.

Simply by saying: "Take me to the Eiffel Tower.", a user is taken to Paris.
